## Concepts

# Types of cloud computing

## IaaS (Infraustructure as a service)
### Definition
Provides building blocks for cloud IT: virtual servers, storage, and networking. You manage the OS, applications, and configurations.  
### why it matters?
Gives companies flexibility and control without owning physical hardware. Good for businesses that want customization but donâ€™t want to manage a data center.
### AWS Examples  
- EC2 (virtual servers)  
- EBS (block storage for EC2)  
- VPC (networking)  
- S3 (object storage, sometimes considered IaaS)  
### Analogy  
Like renting an unfurnished apartment: you get the space (walls, electricity, water), but you need to furnish it and take care of the inside.  
### Key Takeaways  
- High control, high responsibility  
- You patch, secure, and configure everything above the hardware  
- Best for when you want custom environments

## PaaS (Platform as a service)
### Definition
- removes the need for organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
- focus on the deployment and management of your applications

## Saas (Software as a service)
###
- Completed a product that is run and manage by the service provider
